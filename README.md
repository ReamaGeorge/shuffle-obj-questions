## Shuffle-Obj-Questios

## Overview

As an educator, one of the consistent challenges faced is the need to reorganize objective questions to generate various question formats, all aimed at deterring cheating during examinations. The Question Shuffler software is specifically designed to address this challenge by shuffling objective questions into four distinct question types, along with shuffling their respective options.

## Features

- **Question Shuffling**: The software allows educators to input a set of objective questions and shuffles them into four different question types, enhancing the variety of questions in an exam.
- **Option Shuffling**: Along with shuffling questions, the software shuffles the options within each question, further discouraging cheating.
- **Scientific Expression Support**: The software supports the insertion of scientific expressions, symbols, and formulas into questions or options, facilitating the creation of diverse question formats.

## Usage

1. **Input Number of Questions**: Enter the desired number of questions for the exam.
2. **Enter Questions and Options**: Input the questions and their corresponding options into the provided fields.
3. **Insert Scientific Expressions**: Click on the "Insert" button to include scienctific expressions, symbols, formulas, or equations into the questions or options.
4. **Generate Exam**: After inputting the questions and options, click the "Generate" button to shuffle the questions and options into different formats.
5. **Download Exam Versions**: The software generates multiple versions of the exam in Word document format, each with shuffled questions and options.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/shuffle-obj-questions.git

## Current Challenges

While the Question Shuffler software aims to provide educators with a convenient tool for generating diverse exam formats, there are some challenges that I am currently facing with the program:

1. **Limited Experience with Flask**: As someone who is not familiar with Flask, the aesthetics of the application are not optimal. I'm still learning how to improve the user interface and overall user experience.

2. **Download Location**: Currently, the software generates exam versions in Word document format, but I haven't been able to figure out how to make the program download the files directly into the user's download folder. This feature would enhance the usability of the software by simplifying the process for educators.

3. **Handling Special Characters and Scientific Expressions**: I'm yet to figure out how users can input special characters, mathematical expressions, formulas, and scientific symbols into the questions or options. Enabling this functionality would make the software more versatile and useful for creating a wide range of exam questions.

4. **Ensuring Security**: It's important to ensure that the questions generated by the Question Shuffler are not easily copied or accessed by unauthorized individuals. Implementing security measures to protect the integrity of the questions and prevent cheating is a priority, but I'm currently exploring the best practices and techniques to achieve this within the software.

## How You Can Help

Contributions and suggestions to address these challenges are highly appreciated! If you have experience with Flask, file downloading in web applications, integrating tools for inputting special characters and scientific expressions, or implementing security measures in educational software, your expertise would be invaluable in improving the Question Shuffler software.

Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the functionality, usability, and security of the Question Shuffler to better serve educators and students alike.
